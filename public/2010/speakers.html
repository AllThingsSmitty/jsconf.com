              <div class="description">Erlang is great for building concurrent and robust applications. Javascript is wonderful for building all kinds of applications. C is the lingua franca of low-level programming and highly useful for gluing random bits of code together. Learn how I used all three languages to build a very useful library which capitalizes on the strengths of all three languages.<br/>We're going get dirty and explore how to get two very different languages to play nice and get along with each other. If you're curious about how to embed Javascript in your application or the finer points of wrestling Erlang's C API, then this talk is for you.

              <div class="description">Coding for performance by utilizing feature testing, method forking, lazy method defining, and avoiding unnecessary abstraction. The second topic discussed is what I look for in a CSS selector engine. Engines should be chosen based on how they maintain consistent results across browsers, follow specification, and support the browsers required by your project. The third topic discussed is the who/what/when/where of sandboxed natives. I will explain the history, process of creating, and the advantages of using sandboxed natives.</div>

              <div class="title">The front-end takeover or how to use <a href="http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/">Sammy.js</a> to stop writing server side code</div>
              <div class="description">With all the talk and hype over server side platforms and technologies, somehow we've been neglecting the most ubiquitous and widely used javascript platform - the browser. Differences aside, the web browser and the desktop are becoming more and more entwined and just generally faster. Now is our chance to make web applications that surpass the usefulness and awesomeness of desktop counterparts. Sure, there are technologies that allow you to bring desktop style code to the web. With Sammy.js, I'm more interested in creating web style apps that can compete as desktop experiences. Sammy.js is a very simple framework for organizing browser based javascript applications. Despite its size, when combined with other cutting edge technologies, (CouchDB, other RESTful DB's, Comet) it becomes a very powerful way to write entirely front-end, entirely JavaScript applications. I'll walk through the basics of Sammy, show some cool examples of Sammy in production, and talk about new features and technologies that make this all a pretty exciting time to be writing JS.</div>
