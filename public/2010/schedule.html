        <h2>Ye Ship's Course Friday Night April 16, 2010 - Sunday Night April 18, 2010</h2>
        <div id='events_schedule'>
          <p>Blimey mates, it be time to get ready for your journey! We are still putting the names into the timeslots, but for now here is the most important things you need to know about your life from April 16th - April 19th 2010.</p>

          <h3><a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyent</a>'s <a href="scurvy.html">ScurvyConf</a> - Friday Night April 16, 2010 7:00PM - 11:00PM</h3>
          <p>The opening ceremonies of the Olympics will pale in comparison to the trouble we will rouse up at <a href="http://www.lovethebeer.com/rfd.html">Port RFD</a> Friday night. Not for the lily-livered, Friday night plays host to our newest and hottest addition to JSConf, <a href="scurvy.html">ScurvyConf</a>. Due to the amazing volume of speaker requests, we were dedicated to find a way to allow everyone to speak at ScurvyConf! They will be given time, a drink, and a chance to appease the angry mob that has assembled!! It's going to be a riotously great time and if you don't believe us, <a href="http://www.lovethebeer.com/rfd-menu/bottle-list.pdf">look at this</a>! It be good for what ales ya! The event is brought to you by the amazing people at <a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyent</a> and will include food, drinking, and epic topics of discussion. Come out with friends you know, come out with random people, just be sure to come out! For ScurvyConf, we will are inviting significant others free of charge, but <abbr title="not significant other and not JSConf attending">stowaways</abbr> will have to pay $30.00 to board and they get unlimited food and drink as well. Stowaway tickets will go on sale the week before the event (April 9, 2010).</p>

          <h3>Saturday April 17, 2010</h3>
          <p>During the day you will be witness to some epic content provided by these swashbucklers. Also our Hacker's Lounge, sponsored by <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> will be open as well as the free-form First-Come, First-Served speaking event - Track B which is sponsored by the dread pirates <a href="http://jupiterit.com/">Jupiter Consulting</a>. The day will start with breakfast being served from 7:30AM - 8:30AM and the conference officially kicking off at 8:30AM. The day will go until around 5:00 PM, where we will give you just a bit of time to freshen up for your...</p>
          <h3>THE <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/">Y!DN</a> PIRATE CRUISE - Saturday Night, April 17, 2010 - 7:00PM - 10:00PM</h3>
          <p>You have to admit, we definitely deliver on the promise of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NI6iu7e91Y">Ridiculous</a>! The event will include a full buffet dinner (<a href="http://www.spiritofwashington.com/dc/dinner_menu.jsp">menu</a>) and an open bar of beer, rum, and soft drinks for all to get well into the mood of pirating. The boat will be leaving the shore at 7:00PM for a three hour tour around <a href="http://www.spiritofwashington.com/dc/cruise_route.jsp">Washington DC's main waterway</a>. We will be coordinating transportation (details available later) but plan your night accordingly, because lets be frank - it doesn't get much more pirate than being "on a boat, I'm on a boat. Everybody look at me, cause I am sailing a boat!" We will be providing some outfits for this journey, but by all means are you encouraged to go overboard and dress up in pirate outfits!! We do not recommend bringing laptops or backpacks as they will slow you down during the swashbuckling! Significant others are invited to this event as well, but we do have to ask for a small fee for each attending so we can both get a count and cover the cost of the boat and food.</p>
          <h3>Sunday, April 18, 2010</h3>
          <p>Assuming we all make it back alive, Sunday will begin at 9:00AM to compensate for the late return to port. As with Saturday, Track A, Track B and the Hacker's Lounge will be open and rocking. If your mind is not completely rocked by the end of the day, either you slept the day in bed to recover OR we failed our task, and we never fail tasks!</p>
          <h3>The <a href="http://www.rga.com">R/GA</a> Closing Ceremonies - Sunday Night, April 18, 2010 - 8:00PM - ?</h3>
          <p>How do finish out an epic conference? Simple, you throw the most kick-ass party ever and <a href="http://www.rga.com">R/GA</a> is right there to pull it off! Held in the happening <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Street_Corridor">U Street corridor of Washington DC</a>, its going to be the event of JSConf. We definitely do not recommend flying out early Monday. U Street is a live, vibrant area that is more action packed than Chuck Norris! Sorry that is Chuck Effing Norris. Food and drink will be included as always and significant others are welcome to join. This will be your last chance to meet everyone and if you don't, the JSConf team will track you down and you will not like it. The venue for all of this pillaging and ransacking is still in final stages, but trust us - its going to be crazy town.</p>
          <h3>Monday Morning - April 19, 2010</h3>
          <p>Head out armed with the greatest knowledge in the technology community and change the world. This isn't an idea, its a demand.</p>
          <p>We don't ask much of our attendees, do we?</p>
