		<h2>ScurvyConf '10</h2>
        <div>
		  <p>Avast! What good would a pirate conference be without a mess of outcasts, bilge-rats, scoundrels, and... of course... lots of swig? That's right! It'd be limper than a one-legged land-lubber! JSConf is no place for that kind of rabble.</p>
		  <h3>We heartily present to ye... ScurvyConf...</h3>
		  <p>...the most epic gathering of scallywags ever to smell of Davy Jones' Locker.</p>
		  <p>All ye dastardly knaves that submitted yer talks but still had to walk the plank, never fear! Due to the amazing response of speaker requests, we want everyone to still get a chance to speak -- at ScurvyConf. But watch out, you must appease the drinking masses!</p>
		  <p>For ye spectators, don't fret: Speakers will only have 15 minutes, with a beer in one hand and a microphone in the other. They'll fight for their very lives before you, and in the end, you will decide who survives! The pirate with the most votes comes back for an encore performance to speak in an official slot at JSConf!<p>
		
          <h3>The event is sponsored by the amazing people at <a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyent</a> - Friday Night April 16, 2010 7:00PM - 11:00PM</h3>

          <p>We'll gather at <a href="http://www.lovethebeer.com/rfd.html">Port RFD</a> Friday night to toast our new tradition, ScurvyConf. JSConf will never be the same again!</p>
		  
		  <p>Expect food, drinking, and epic topics of discussion. Come out with friends you know, come out with random people, just be sure to come out! For ScurvyConf, we will are inviting significant others free of charge, but <abbr title="not significant other and not JSConf attending">stowaways</abbr> will have to pay $30.00 to board and they get unlimited food and drink as well. Stowaway tickets will go on sale the week before the event (April 9, 2010).</p>

		  <h4>Yours truly,<br />
		      Scurvy Jones</h4>
