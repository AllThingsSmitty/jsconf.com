          <h2>About JSConf</h2>
          <p><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=jsconf">"JSConf is awesome"</a>. That seems to be the going definition of this initimate conference dedicated to the JavaScript programming language. One thing has been made clear, JSConf is one of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/05/jsconf_recap.html">best</a> <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/11/jsconfeu_all_th.html">tech</a> <a href="http://blogs.igalia.com/ltilve/2009/11/12/back-from-jsconf-eu-2009/">conferences</a> out there and rightly so, because JavaScript is one of the best languages out there. The core focus of this conference is to expose the details about JavaScript that are often overlooked and present them more as a discussion with the audience. The content of the conference caters to all types of JavaScript users from client interfaces to server development to testing. No matter which programming language you love, you know of the pleasure and pain of JavaScript programming.</p>
          <p>JSConf focuses on two things, presenting mind-altering JavaScript technology during the daytime and providing exceptional "networking" parties during the evenings. Our goal with JSConf is to establish the JavaScript community as the best out there, if just because we are part of every other major web system out there. That's right, we are part of everything. One of the key things of JSConf is that it isn't run by a big corporation, but by a (crazy) group of JavaScript developers just like you. We make sure the conference is a conference we would want to be at, because we have to be at it.</p>
          <p>We are trying to make something different and we are trying to do it with JavaScript.</p>

          <h2>Calling all JavaScript Visionaries, Craftspeople, and Rebellious Leaders</h2>
          <p>We are bringing together the top minds in JavaScript for a truly memorable and mindblowing time. Do you have a great 
          product, project, or concept in JavaScript that you think the world needs to see? JSConf is the launching point for
          everything JavaScript in 2010 and beyond; at least until JSConf EU. The JSConf team has made a firm commitment to making 
          it the best technology conference out there, so we need the best damn speakers around, speakers like you.</p>
          <p>In the speaker proposal, we are looking for a description of your topic and why its better than writing documentation. We give extra credit for 
          presentations that challenge the status quo, stir up emotions within the crowd, and are banned in at least 3 states. JavaScript
          should be the focus, but should not be a limiter, so go ahead and submit your dissertation on unicorns. Examples of 
          presentations from 2009 can be found at the JSConf <a href='http://jsconf.us/2009'>US</a> and <a href=''>EU</a> websites</a>.</p>
          <p>You get one shot at this, so don't mess it up. We need from you a JSON encoded submission of your proposal with the 
          following attributes at a minimum. Malformed submissions will be laughed at.</p>
          <code class="example">
            { name: "Mr. Sample", email: "info@jsconf.us", location: "Washington DC", topic_title: "I like p0wn13s", topic_description, "", claim_to_fame: "One time, at bandcamp..." }
